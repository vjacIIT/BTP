# BTP
### Overview
Work done at my BTP project at IIT Palakkad. It is a Path finding visualizer in react.

### Run into your own pc
Install nodejs and npm into your operating system.<br />
Go to the directory and type "npm install" in the command line (This will install all the required packages for this project)<br />
Type "npm start" in the command line. A pop up in the local host will occur for the project in your browser. ENJOY!
